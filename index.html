        <h1>Services</h1>
        <h2>The starting rate for my work typically is set at 50 dollars an hour + the cost of plants or other materials. I will be operating mostly during the summer
          I offer services from planting beds of plants to planting larger scrubs as well as putting down materials such as bark or pine straw. I'll also include care
          that's necessary for keeping the plants healhty as well as what each plant is. I can help offer ideas or if you already have a plan i'm perfectly able to
          output yours. Of course i'm flexible with price with each project and how much work is involved
